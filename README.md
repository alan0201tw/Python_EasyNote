# Python_EasyNote

It's a little application I made using some free time , it's very simple but quite useful.
This application can't remember the notes after reboot , hope I'll add this feature in the future.

How to use :
try it yourself!!

Caution : 
Please don't let the note contain double "\n" , it'll cause bug when loading notes.

If you found any bug when using or you have any suggestions , please comment !
